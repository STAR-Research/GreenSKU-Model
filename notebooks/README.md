# Evaluation Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebook(s) that evaluate the carbon model. The notebooks are organized as follows:

- `carbon_savings.ipynb`: This notebook reproduces the (open-sourced) reported carbon savings numbers, tables, and figures in the paper. The notebook uses the carbon model to calculate the carbon savings of a GreenSKU configuration compared to a baseline configuration. The notebook also calculates the carbon savings of a GreenSKU configuration compared to a baseline configuration with a fixed carbon intensity. The notebook reproduces the figures in the paper and provides a detailed explanation of the calculations.

## Carbon savings calculations

Here, we describe the high-level details of the carbon savings calculations in the `carbon_savings.ipynb` notebook.
